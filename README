= Ruby Creole

A full Creole 1.0 Markup lib.

== Why ?

Because I needed one, I just can't live without the Creole syntax.
I've found one in Ruby, but it was only based on regexps, so I
cannot trust it.

This one uses very simple regexps AND two state machines.

== TODO

- Build a gem (I need to learn how-to);
- Plugin system ?
- Escape mechanism isn't finished yet, but essential features are already there.
- Add other formatters ie LaTeX or Lout ones.
